This test is a mimic of an actual single-deck play I tried.
The deck is in `cards.txt` and the play is in `play.txt`.
The results are

```
+1 +2 +2 -1 +1 0 +1 +1.5 -1 -1
```

The mean, variance and standard deviation can be computed with FeenoX:

```
VECTOR r[10] DATA +1 +2 +2 -1 +1 0 +1 +1.5 -1 -1
PRINTF "%.4f %.4f %.4f" vecmean(r) vecvariance(r) vecsd(r)
```

This gives

```
0.5500 1.4694 1.2122
```

Running `blackjack`, we get

```
$ blackjack < play.txt 
play? 20 4

play? 15 5
